Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:
1. Total Loan Applications: We need to calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. Additionally, it is essential to monitor the 
  Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and track changes Month-over-Month (MoM).
2. Total Funded Amount: Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial. We also want to keep an eye on the MTD Total Funded Amount and analyse the
  Month-over-Month (MoM) changes in this metric.
3. Total Amount Received: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment. We should analyse the 
  Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Amount Received and observe the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
4. Average Interest Rate: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitoring the Month-over-Month (MoM) variations in interest rates will provide 
  insights into our lending portfolio's overall cost.
5. Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health. We need to compute the average DTI for all loans,
  MTD, and track Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations.

CHARTS
1. Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart):  To identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities
2. Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map): To identify regions with significant lending activity and assess regional disparities
3. Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart): To allow the client to understand the distribution of loans across various term lengths.
4. Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart): How lending metrics are distributed among borrowers with different employment lengths, helping us assess the impact of employment 
  history on loan applications.
5. Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart): Will provide a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on the stated purposes of loans, aiding in the understanding of the primary 
  reasons borrowers seek financing.
6. Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map): For a hierarchical view of how home ownership impacts loan applications and disbursements.
